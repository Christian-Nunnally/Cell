By default functions should be owned by a sheet, and only cells from that sheet can use them. If a function is shared, it should be copied to the sheet that is using it.
This allows more references to be auto updated when rows are inserted or deleted.
Some functions might make sense from a global perspective though, like IsInt. should these be able to be shared between sheets?
maybe functions should identify whether they are used by more than one sheet automatically?
