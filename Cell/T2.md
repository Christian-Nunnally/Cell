When a template is imported, allow a mode that will copy all functions and refactor them with new collections

Functions are able to identify c.GetUserList<>()

Sheets have a mapping from collection to collection

By default functions should be owned by a sheet, and only cells from that sheet can use them. If a function is shared, it should be copied to the sheet that is using it.
This allows more references to be auto updated when rows are inserted or deleted.
Some functions might make sense from a global perspective though, like IsInt. should these be able to be shared between sheets?
maybe functions should identify whether they are used by more than one sheet automatically? 

Add a "restore from backup" button that
x 1. backs up the current save
2. lets the user pick a backup to restore from
3. deletes the cell directory
1. copies the backup cell directory to the current cell directory
1. closes the application

Allow creating rows/columns from row/column cells
