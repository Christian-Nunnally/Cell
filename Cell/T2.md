TF:

- Fix whatever is causing multiple cells to be copied (is it undo redo? I don't think it's happened recently)
- Make undo/redo work for updating a cells text manually
- Make more things load lazily
- Make windows appear in a sensible location
- make deleting an item from the filtered collection delete the item from the original collection, maybe prompt the user
- When an item is changed in a base collection consider adding it to filtered collections
- Make export also copy collections used by listbox cells
- Add ability to add item from collection manager
