TF:
- Verify that cells exist before assuming a veriable like "cell2" is a cell reference.


- Write a test that verifies that cells dependency locations are recalculated when the row or column change
When a row is iserted at the top of the page references like
A1 should stay the same, because the function could be reused anywhere and the reference could point to any row.
R_A1 (also B_A1) should be incremented to R_A2 (also B_A2) iff it is in the same or greater row than the inserted row.

Only cell references with sheet names should increment (is this annoying? should functions be assigned to a sheet by default?)
